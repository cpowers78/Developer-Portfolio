# <Developer Portfolio>
  
  This is my portfolio project. I used the starting code from https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-portfolio-website-react/ for the general template. I then edited the UI and removed some components, and added others. It details my projects that I've been working on and also provides links to LinkedIn and Github.
